Have a shapefile without a .prj? Or with a wrong .prj?

1. Zip the .shp and .shx (& whatever)
2. Drag the .zip onto the map
3. Wait
4. Zoom to what you think is the correct location / size / shape.
5. Click on the one that looks best.
6. Click on the ".prj" link in the info popup
7. Save that esriwkt file to <your_shapefile_name>.prj

Only tested with single polygons.
More for art than for science.
But who knows, might be useful.
